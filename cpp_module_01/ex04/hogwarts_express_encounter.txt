*Harry Potter is sitting in the Hogwarts express. Ron
Weasley shows up.*

Ron : Excuse me, do you mind *he points to the seat*,
everywhere else is full...
Harry : Sure, take a seat! 
Ron : What’s your name?
Harry: My name is Harry Potter.
Ron : Really? Where is your scar? *Harry shows his scar.*
Ron *impressed* : Incredible! Hi, I’m Ron Weasley.
Harry : Nice to meet you.
*Ron is testing magic spells. Hermione Granger arrives.*

Hermione : Oh, you’re doing magic! I can do a bit of magic
too : Occulus reparo! *she repairs Harry’s glasses. Then she
notices the scar*
YOU ARE Harry Potter! I am Hermione Granger. *To Ron* And
you, you are ...?
Ron : Ron Weasley.
Hermione : Pleasure!
