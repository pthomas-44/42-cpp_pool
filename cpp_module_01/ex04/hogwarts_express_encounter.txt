Harry Potter is sitting in the Hogwarts express. Ron
Weasley shows up.

Ron : Excuse me, do you mind (he points to the seat),
everywhere else is full...
Harry : Sure, take a seat! 
Ron : What’s your name?
Harry: My name is Harry Potter.
Ron : Really? Where is your scar? Harry shows his scar.
Ron (impressed) : Incredible! Hi, I’m Ron Weasley.
Harry : Nice to meet you.
Ron is testing magic spells. Hermione Granger arrives.

Hermione : Oh, you’re doing magic! I can do a bit of magic
too : Occulus reparo! (she repairs Harry’s glasses. Then she
notices the scar) 
YOU ARE Harry Potter! I am Hermione Granger. (To Ron) And
you, you are ...?
Ron : Ron Weasley.
Hermione : Pleasure!
